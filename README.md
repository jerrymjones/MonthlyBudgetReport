MoneyDance Monthly Budget Report

For help using this extension see the [Wiki](https://github.com/jerrymjones/MonthlyBudgetReport/wiki).

Monthly Budget Report is an extension for the [Moneydance](https://moneydance.com/)
Personal Finance app to help you report how well you are meeting your monthly spending 
goals. The main reason to us this extension instead of the built in Moneydance 
budget report is that this extension properly handles negative budget amounts.
I see a budget as being fluid throughout the year. Budget amounts always need
to be updated throughout the year as spending changes and I like to be able to 
borrow from categories I'm underspending while allocating the extra to categories
that are becoming overspent. There may be special occasions, such as when someone
refunds part of the money spent earlier in the year that you may need to enter a 
negative budget amount so that the budget accurately reflects the changes. An
example would be for car insurance. At times our insurer may issue a refund of
some of the earlier premium based on conditions during the year. Of course I 
could just adjust the earlier amounts to get to the proper amount spent but I'd
rather be able to track exactly what happened in the budget. If you don't want 
that ability, you may just want to use the default Moneydance budget report.

Monthly Budget Report is a companion to to my [Monthly Budget Editor](https://github.com/jerrymjones/MonthlyBudgetEditor) that not only
allows for negative budget amounts but also allows for easy entry of budget
amounts in a compact spreadsheet style format.
